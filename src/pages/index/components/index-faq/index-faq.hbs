			<p>1. Why CATA? How is CATA different from other fashion apps using AI?</p>
			<span></span>
		</div>
		<div class="accordion__content">
			<p>
				Having strong engineers is table stakes in AI. But using existing models is a guarantee that you’re competing with yesterday’s tech. What sets CATA apart is that we’re not just plugging into off-the-shelf models; we are committed to training and shaping the ML that will lead and define a new category of commerce and self expression.
